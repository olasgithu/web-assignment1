	<h1>Life Cycle of a Star</h1>
	
	<p>Stars are the luminous engines of the Universe, shaping galaxies and producing the elements essential for life. Their journey through life—from birth to death—is a story of transformation and impact.</p>
	
	<h3>Stages of a Star’s Life Cycler</h3>
	
		
	<h3>1. Birth: Nebula to Protostar</h3>
	
	<p>Stars begin as clouds of dust and gas (nebulae). Gravity pulls these particles together, forming a protostar, where intense heat and pressure ignite nuclear fusion, marking the star's birth.</p>
	
	<h3>2. Main Sequence</h3>
	
	<p>This is the longest phase of a star's life, where it converts hydrogen into helium in its core. A star's size and brightness during this period depend on its mass:<br>
<br>
       Small stars glow faintly and live for billions of years.<br>

       Massive stars burn brightly but exhaust their fuel in a few million years.</p>
	
	<h3>3. Expansion: Red Giant or Red Supergiant</h3>
	
	<p>When hydrogen runs out, stars expand.<br>
		
		<br>
         Low and medium-mass stars swell into red giants.<br>
		
         Massive stars become enormous red supergiants, fusing heavier elements in their cores.</p>
	
	
	<h3>4. The End</h3>
	
		<p>
         Low/Medium-Mass Stars: Shed outer layers as planetary nebulae, leaving behind a dense white dwarf that cools over billions of years.<br>
		
        High-Mass Stars: Collapse into a core, triggering a supernova. This explosion may leave behind a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the core’s mass.</p>
	
	
	<h3>A Star’s Legacy</h3>
	
	<p>Stars forge the elements that make up planets, life, and even us. The carbon in our bodies and the iron in our blood were formed in ancient stars that exploded billions of years ago.</p>
